# Rules:
- Code only in english.
- Only program in files associated with the branch you are currently in.
- Always verify that you are in the correct branch for what you're working on.
- Always pull from master into your branch before you start working.
- Avoid pulling from other branches than main.
- ALWAYS document your program through Doxygen style headers
- Notify once you are done with a part so that it can be integrated into the program.
